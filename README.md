# Huffman and Shannon Codes
## Overview
This is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to apply Huffman and Shannon coding to a given dataset (e.g., text) to encode characters efficiently, while also calculating entropy to analyze the data compression efficiency. These are foundational concepts in information theory. 
The notebook includes code for generating Huffman codes and Shannon codes based on the frequency of characters in a text, while also simulating potential errors through channel transmission.
